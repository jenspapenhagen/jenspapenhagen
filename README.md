## Jens Papenhagen

Java Full Stack Developer. Most repositories are private and used for testing, experimentation, or internal projects.

## About Me

I am a software developer with a strong focus on Java backend development and microservices. I work professionally as a full stack developer and use GitHub to explore new technologies, build small services, and prototype ideas. My public repositories mainly reflect experiments, utilities, and proof-of-concepts rather than polished products.

Location: Hamburg, Germany
